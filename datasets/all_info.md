> This Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to conquest by which empire?

* The Norman conquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later styled as William the Conqueror.
* Constantine the Great (Latin: "Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus" ; Greek: Κωνσταντῖνος ὁ Μέγας ; 27 February 272 AD – 22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor of Illyrian-Greek origin from 306 to 337 AD.
    -  He was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena.
    -  His father became "Caesar", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD.
    -  Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under Emperors Diocletian and Galerius.
    -  In 305, Constantius raised himself to the rank of "Augustus", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain).
    -  Constantine was acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, and he emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against Emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD.
* The Carolingian Empire (800–888) was a large empire in western and central Europe during the early Middle Ages.
    -  It was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty, which had ruled as kings of the Franks since 751 and as kings of the Lombards of Italy from 774.
    -  In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in an effort to revive the Roman Empire in the west during a vacancy in the throne of the eastern Roman Empire.
    -  After a civil war (840–43) following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms, with one king still recognised as emperor, but with little authority outside his own kingdom.
    -  The unity of the empire and the hereditary right of the Carolingians continued to be acknowledged.
* The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain (Latin: "Britannia" ).
    -  Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.
    -  In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.
* The Roman Empire (Latin: "Imperium Rōmānum" ; ] Koine and Medieval Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων, tr.
    -  "Basileia tōn Rhōmaiōn" ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia.
    -  The city of Rome was the largest city in the world  100 BC  AD 400 , with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around AD 500, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time).
    -  The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC.
    -  Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt.
    -  Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title "Augustus", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.

* The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolingus, Carolings or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD.
    -  The name "Carolingian" (Medieval Latin "karolingi", an altered form of an unattested Old High German word *"karling, kerling", meaning "descendant of Charles", cf. MHG "kerlinc") derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: "Carolus".
    -  The dynasty consolidated its power in the mid 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and "dux et princeps Francorum" hereditary, and becoming the "de facto" rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne.
    -  In 751 the Merovingian dynasty, which had ruled the Germanic Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian Pepin the Short was crowned King of the Franks.
    -  The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of Romans in over three centuries.
    -  His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire.
* The Franks (Latin: "Franci" or "gens Francorum ") were a collection of Germanic peoples that originated in the lands between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD and eventually formed a large empire dominating much of western and central Europe during the Middle Ages.
    -  The Frankish Empire ultimately led to the birth of modern France and Germany and thus the Franks are seen as the forebears of the French and German peoples (in addition to Austrians, the Dutch, Luxembourgers and some other European nations).
* Charlemagne ( ) or Charles the Great (2 April 742 – 28 January 814), numbered Charles I, was King of the Franks from 768, King of the Lombards from 774 and Emperor of the Romans from 800.
    -  He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages.
    -  He was the first recognised emperor in western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.
    -  The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is called the Carolingian Empire.
* The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium).
    -  It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.
    -  During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe.
    -  Both "Byzantine Empire" and "Eastern Roman Empire" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the "Roman Empire" (Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων , tr.
    -  "Basileia tôn Rhōmaiōn" ; Latin: "Imperium Romanum" ), or "Romania" (Ῥωμανία ), and to themselves as "Romans".
* Aulus Plautius was a Roman politician and general of the mid-1st century.
    -  He began the Roman conquest of Britain in 43, and became the first governor of the new province, serving from 43 to 46.
* The Roman Republic (Latin: Res publica Romana ; ] ) was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire.
    -  It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.
* Medieval Greek, also known as Byzantine Greek, is the stage of the Greek language between the end of Classical antiquity in the 5th-6th centuries and the end of the Middle Ages, conventionally dated to the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453.
    -  From the 7th century onwards, Greek was the only language of administration and government in the Byzantine Empire.
    -  This stage of language is thus described as Byzantine Greek.
    -  The study of the Medieval Greek language and literature is a branch of Byzantine Studies, or Byzantinology, the study of the history and culture of the Byzantine Empire.
* The Ptolemaic Kingdom ( ; Ancient Greek: Πτολεμαϊκὴ βασιλεία , "Ptolemaïkḕ basileía") was a Hellenistic kingdom based in Egypt.
